# The setup.py file is used to package and distribute Python projects â€” especially when you're creating a reusable module or library.

# When to use setup.py:
# You want to convert your code into a package others (or even you) can install with pip.

# You're working on a modular project or library (like a Python module, ML pipeline, or CLI tool).

# You're building a project that you plan to:

# Publish on PyPI

# Share with your team

# Use across multiple projects
